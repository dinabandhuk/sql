# The art of postgresql second edition by Dimitri Fontaine

## Chapter 1

---

- Most developers are familiar with `SQL'89` and the current standard is `SQL 23 ISO/IEC 9075:2023`

---

### A first use case

- the site has moved so couldn't find [this](http://www.nyxdata.com/nysedata/asp/factbook/viewer_edition.asp?mode=table&key=3141&category=3) dataset.
- `\copy` variant initiates client server streaming of data and sends it through pgsql connection.

```sql
\copy factbook from 'factbook.csv' with delimiter E'\t' null ''
```

- `decorated literal expression` is used so that postgresql query parser won't have to infer or guess the data type from context
- Data type formatting functions have locale, group seperators(commas) etc

---

### SQL Injection

![exploits of a mom](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png)

- never build query string by directly concatenating query arguments
- Look ar ORM or driver docs and don't use those if they do that
- postgres has protocol level facility to send static query arguments seperately from dynamic arguments so we never have to worry about injection if we use it correctly.

---

### Postgresql protocol : server side prepared statements

- `PQexecParams` allows sending query string and arguments seperately using server side prepared statements.
- thanks to `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` commands.

```sql
prepare foo as
 select date, shares, trades, dollars
    from factbook
    where date >= $1::date
    and date < $1::date + interval '1 month'
 order by date;
```

```sql
execute foo('2004-04-14');
```

- query strings are sent in `BIND` message and parameters are sent in `EXECUTE` message so cannot inject anything.
- `Extended Query` implements the `PARSE` `BIND` `EXECUTE`
- `asyncpg` python package implements this protocol.

```sql
--  one line sql comment --

/* multiline
 * comment 
 * in postgresql
*/ 
```

- *generate_series()* : generate values from start to stop with given step size. `set returning` inclusive function.
- **Some code snippets and functions left out for brevity**
