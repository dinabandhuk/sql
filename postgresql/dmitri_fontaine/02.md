# Chapter 2: Software Architecture

- Heavylifting in SQL allows for efficiency by reducing the round trip times, issues of latency and memory bandwidth because they are correlated with size of the result sets.

- `online backups` mitigates disk corruption risks. OS failure is covered by Durabiliy.
- Postgresql implements a stateful service
- SQL is strongly typed and pgsql allows casting, polymorphism and extensibility
- SQL functions are defined in a catalog and looked up at runtime
- Think of pgsql as *concurrent data access service* , not as *storage layer*
- postgres documentation needs to be updated along with the relevant software patch making it up to date.
